# Integrating Your Auction Mini App with Telegram

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating your auction mini app with Telegram.

## 1. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather" bot.
2. Start a chat with BotFather and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. Follow the prompts to choose a name and username for your bot.
4. Save the API token provided by BotFather; you'll need this later.

## 2. Set Up Your Mini App

1. Go to BotFather and use the `/newapp` command to create a new mini app.
2. Choose the bot you just created to associate with this mini app.
3. Provide a short name for your mini app (this will be used in the URL).
4. Upload a photo that will serve as the app icon (512x512 pixels).

## 3. Configure Your Mini App

1. Use the `/myapps` command in BotFather to see your list of apps.
2. Select your newly created mini app.
3. Choose "Edit Bot Web App URL" and enter the URL where your app is hosted (the one provided after deployment).

## 4. Implement Telegram Mini App SDK

1. Add the Telegram Web App script to your `index.html`:

   ```html
   <script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js"></script>
   ```

2. In your main React component (`App.tsx`), initialize the Telegram WebApp:

   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     // @ts-ignore
     const tg = window.Telegram.WebApp;
     tg.ready();
     // You can also expand the app to its maximum size
     tg.expand();
   }, []);
   ```

3. Use the Telegram WebApp methods to interact with the Telegram client. For example:

   ```typescript
   const user = window.Telegram.WebApp.initDataUnsafe?.user;
   if (user) {
     console.log('Telegram user:', user);
     // Use user data to personalize the app
   }
   ```

## 5. Implement Main Button (Optional)

If you want to add a main button at the bottom of your app:

```typescript
const tg = window.Telegram.WebApp;
tg.MainButton.setText('Place Bid');
tg.MainButton.show();
tg.MainButton.onClick(() => {
  // Handle button click
});
```

## 6. Handle Back Button (Optional)

To properly handle the back button in Telegram:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const tg = window.Telegram.WebApp;
  tg.BackButton.show();
  tg.BackButton.onClick(() => {
    // Handle navigation or close the app
    tg.close();
  });
}, []);
```

## 7. Testing Your Mini App

1. Open your Telegram bot in the Telegram app.
2. You should see a "Start" button. Tap it to open your mini app.
3. Test all functionalities to ensure they work within the Telegram environment.

## 8. Publishing Your Mini App

1. Once you're satisfied with your testing, go back to BotFather.
2. Use the `/myapps` command and select your mini app.
3. Choose "Submit for moderation" to have your app reviewed by Telegram.

## Best Practices

- Ensure your app is responsive and works well on various device sizes.
- Use Telegram's theme variables to match your app's style with the user's Telegram theme.
- Implement proper error handling and provide feedback to users.
- Consider using Telegram's native features like sharing and payments for a seamless experience.

## Troubleshooting

- If your app doesn't load, double-check the URL you provided in BotFather.
- Ensure your app is served over HTTPS.
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.
- Verify that you're correctly handling the Telegram WebApp initialization.

Remember to always test your mini app thoroughly before submitting it for review. Good luck with your Telegram Mini App integration!
